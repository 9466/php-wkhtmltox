PHP bindings for the fabulous libwkhtmltox

Special thanks to antialize for creating wkhtmltopdf: http://github.com/antialize/wkhtmltopdf


Tested on:
 * Mac OSX 10.6.4 Snow Leopard, PHP 5.2.12 (64-bit)


Pre-requisites on all platforms:
--------------------------------
 * you need libwkhtmltox.* somewhere in your LD path (/usr/local/lib)
 * you need the directory src/include/wkhtmltox from wkhtmltopdf somewhere on your include path (/usr/local/include)


Notes on compiling for Mac OSX 10.6.4 Snow Leopard (64-bit libwkhtmltox only):
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * until this bug is fixed (http://bugreports.qt.nokia.com/browse/QTBUG-5952) you need qt_menu.nib directory from the QT source tree in the same directory as your libwkhtmltox.* libs


Installation
------------
$ phpize
$ ./configure
$ make install

edit your php.ini and add:
    extension=phpwkhtmltox.so
